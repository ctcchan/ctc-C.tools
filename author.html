                <p>The music of Chin Ting (Patrick) CHAN (b. 1986) stems from an interest in representing his impressions of the visual world with sonic images. It is often inspired by patterns and shapes he discovers in daily objects, as well as imaginary landscapes he sometimes encounters. These abstract concepts are projected to a music that is characterized by complex harmonic progressions within a multi-layered texture.</p>
                <p>Chan has been a fellow and guest composer at the International Computer Music Conference, the International Rostrum of Composers, IRCAM’s ManiFeste, the ISCM World Music Days Festival, June in Buffalo, the mise-en music festival and the Wellesley Composers Conference. He has held residencies with the Charlotte Street Foundation and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and has received commissions and grants from ArtsKC, the Hong Kong Composers' Guild and the Music Teachers National Association, as well as performances by Ensemble Signal, the Nouveau Classical Project and the S.E.M. Ensemble, in venues such as Staatstheater Darmstadt, the Seoul Arts Center and the Tongyeong Concert Hall, among many others. Awards and other recognitions include those from the American Prize, ASCAP, Association for the Promotion of New Music, the Cortona Sessions for New Music, Foundation Destellos, Foundation for Modern Music, the Interdisciplinary Festival for Music and Sound Art – Shut Up and Listen!, the Lin Yao Ji Music Foundation of China, the MidAmerican Center for Contemporary Music, newEar, the New-Music Consortium, the Portland Chamber Music Festival, the RED NOTE New Music Festival, Semaine international de la musique électroacoustique, the Soli fan tutti Composition Prize and others.</p>
                <p>Raised in Hong Kong, Chan is Assistant Professor of Music Composition at Ball State University. He previously held faculty positions at the University of Missouri–Kansas City and Kansas City Kansas Community College.
