                <p>The music of Chin Ting (Patrick) CHAN (b. 1986) stems from an interest in representing his impressions of the visual world with sonic images. It is often inspired by patterns and shapes he discovers in daily objects, as well as imaginary landscapes he sometimes encounters. These abstract concepts are projected to a music that is characterized by complex harmonic progressions within a multi-layered texture.</p>
                <p>Chan has been a fellow and guest composer at the International Computer Music Conference, the International Rostrum of Composers, IRCAM’s ManiFeste, the ISCM World Music Days Festival, June in Buffalo and the Wellesley Composers Conference, and has held residencies with the Charlotte Street Foundation and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts. He has received commissions from the Hong Kong Composers' Guild and the Music Teachers National Association, as well as performances by Ensemble Signal, the Nouveau Classical Project and the S.E.M. Ensemble, in venues such as the Darmstadt State Theatre and the Seoul Arts Center, among many others. Awards and other recognition include those from the Interdisciplinary Festival for Music and Sound Art, Semaine international de la musique électroacoustique, the Soli fan tutti Composition Prize, the American Prize, ArtsKC, ASCAP, Association for the Promotion of New Music, the Cortona Sessions for New Music, Foundation Destellos, Foundation for Modern Music, the Lin Yao Ji Music Foundation of China, the MidAmerican Center for Contemporary Music, newEar, the New-Music Consortium, the Portland Chamber Music Festival, the RED NOTE New Music Festival and others.</p>
                <p>Raised in Hong Kong, Chan has held faculty positions at the University of Missouri–Kansas City and Kansas City Kansas Community College. He holds degrees from San José State University (B.M.), Bowling Green State University (M.M.) and the University of Missouri–Kansas City (D.M.A.). His works are published with the ABLAZE Records, Darling’s Acoustical Delight, Melos Music, Music from SEAMUS, Navona Records/PARMA Recordings, the SCI Journal of Music Scores and Unfolding Music Publishing (ASCAP). <a href="http://www.chintingchan.com" target="_blank">www.chintingchan.com</a></p>
